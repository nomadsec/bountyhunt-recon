## bash script for opening salvo of (web) recon

Don't run this unless you know what each tool does and you have read the terms or scope of your target - modify it accordingly. i.e. is brute forcing directories allowed?

This is just the script I use when I first start recon on a new bug bounty program. I might try to come back to this and explain when to use it, when to modify it, etc. But if you read the docs for each tool or know them already it's probably fairly self-explanatory. It's nice to let this run and free you up to do more manual recon/osint

happy hacking :)
